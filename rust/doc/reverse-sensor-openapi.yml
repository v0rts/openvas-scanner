    # General

    Reverse Scanner is intended for those situation in which the client can     not start a connection from outside the sensor's network, and in this case is the scanner which opens the connection and ask the client for a scan to run.

    Since REST API is stateless, and to avoid sending the feed periodically, a new concept of 'sensor mode' is introduced. This allows the sensor to be changed from one of the two existing modes to the other.

    # Authentication

    The API supports two kinds of authentication methods:

    - API Key

    - Certificates


    The authentication modes are set within a configuration file or via the argument list, when starting the server.

    The authentication is required for each request except for a HEAD request.

    ## API Key

    An API key is a token that the client provides when doing API requests and are used to authorize access.
    The `X-API-KEY` must be in the header.

    <!--More details about this method follows with its implementation.-->


    ## Certificates

    This option uses [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509), based on CA to verify derived certificates to allow access.


    <!--More details about this method follows with its implementation.-->
