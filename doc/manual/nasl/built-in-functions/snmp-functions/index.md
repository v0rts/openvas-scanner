# SNMP Functions

## GENERAL

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet Standard protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior. Devices that typically support SNMP include cable modems, routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, and more. It is mostly used for network administrator to get information about available network devices and to be able to configure them remotely.

SNMP functions are used to get available SNMP devices in the network.
