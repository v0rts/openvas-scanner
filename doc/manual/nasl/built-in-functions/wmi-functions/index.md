# WMI Functions

## GENERAL

Provides WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) functionalities via calling functions of a appropriate library.
The API offers three groups of functions:
1. WMI_FUNCTIONS: run all-purpose queries
2. WMI_RSOP_FUNCTIONS (RSoP = Resultant Set of Policy): run RSoP queries
3. WMI_REGISTRY_FUNCTIONS: read and write values from/to the registry

In order to be able to use the WMI functions, **[openvas-smb](https://github.com/greenbone/openvas-smb)** has to be installed before.
